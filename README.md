# DIY ML Stuffs

This repository contains my ongoing do-it-yourself style experimentations of ML and DL stuffs.

### Progress so far

##### Sequence-modelling 
- Scratch impl of Character Level RNN inspired by karpathy's code `[done]` 
- RNN `[done]`
- LSTM : Many to one with pytorch `[done]`
- LSTM : Many to many with pytorch `[done]`

##### Attention
- Attention, causal, Multi-head `[done]` 

##### LLMS
- GPT scratch `[done]`
- LLAMA train & infer implementaion `[done]`

##### Classical ML
- Kmeans 
- PCA

##### Karpthy's zero to hero
- Micrograd
- bigram model 
- makemore with Neural Net
