    "Assume we need to find the difference/ how much the probability distribution varies for the same underlying set of outcomes X.\n",

    "Lets say, we measured the probability distribution in 2 timestamp for the same set of X \n",

    "A simple way to calculate relative difference(P wrt Q) is to:\n",

    "-> P(x)/Q(x) and to get overall sense, we can average for all the x \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{x \\in X} \\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "but this is very naive way and have issues, even though P(2) and P(3) has same 20% differnce in opposite directions, the higher value skews the average.\n",
    "\n",
    "we need a function to map both to same value but in opposite direction. \n",

    "we have one final thing to make it better, \n",
    "\n",
    "now, we are weighing all the observations with same weightage, but the changes in higher probabilites needs to be weighted rather than smaller changes just like expectation calculation of a distribution.\n",
    "thats why we instead of equal weightage 1/n , we need to use P(x) \n",
